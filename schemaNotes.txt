Slides: NoSQL Data Modeling Using JSON Documents â€“ A Practical Approach
url: http://www.dataversity.net/slides-nosql-data-modeling-using-json-documents-practical-approach/
Notes:
if -> then
Relationship is one-to-one or one-to-many -> Store related data as nested objects
Relationship is many-to-one or many-to-many -> Store related data as separate documents
Data reads are mostly parent fields -> Store children as separate documents
Data reads are mostly parent + child fields -> Store children as nested objects
Data writes are mostly parent or child (not both) -> Store children as separate objects
Data writes are mostly parent and child (both) -> Store children as nested objects

Are there a lot of concurrent writes, continuous updates?
-Store children as separate documents

Entities: Main objects in your application
Attributes: Properties of the objects in your application
Relationships: Connections between entities, i.e. 1-1, 1-many, many-many
